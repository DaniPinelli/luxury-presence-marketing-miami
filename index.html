                    One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your
                    property to
                    the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify
                    who
                    will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their
                    website,
                    paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered with
                    Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing capabilities the company
                    offers.

                            <p class="fw-bolder carousel-text">To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they
                                are, where
                                they spend their
                                time online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate
                                marketing services are able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on
                                Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property.
                                These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not
                                spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as
                                yours.

                                estate agent has
                                to
                                promote your
                                property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an
                                essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services
                                above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers
                                want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video
                                is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport.
                                When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would
                                really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more
                                difficult to do with a written description.
                                However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to
                                be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional
                                marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get
                                access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and
                                content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

                                purchased on the
                                internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home
                                and started their search that way. For your home to show up in these types of searches,
                                your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing. The
                                effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO. The
                                process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one
                                that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches
                                terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide
                                opportunities for the buyer to learn more.</p>

                                media, he or she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest in
                                property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their
                                time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service
                                providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or
                                her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media presence?
                                At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed
                                posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve
                                harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for
                                your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.

                                navigate and provides an immersive experience for viewers who want to look at
                                properties, they’ve already lost their advantage. Those agents who work with Luxury
                                Presence have websites that are designed and managed by seasoned professionals who know
                                what property buyers want. Their sites are designed to impress with virtual tour
                                integration, HD video capabilities, and lead capture strategies that help agents sell
                                your home. Agents are further supported by analytics reporting, SEO optimization, third
                                party integrations, and a reporting dashboard to help them easily utilize their site and
                                maximize its potential. An agent who is backed by a powerful website is one who can
                                easily reach a niche audience, streamline the selling process, and ensure your home gets
                                the best promotion possible.

                            <p class="fw-bolder carousel-text">No matter how many powerful tools your real estate agent
                                has at his or her disposal, sometimes word-of-mouth marketing is still the best way to
                                sell a property. Agents who work with luxury real estate marketing services are
                                connected with referral partners and a community of agents who can help them find the
                                perfect buyer for your property. They can market your home specifically to individuals
                                they’ve identified through their sources to be ready to purchase a home just like yours.
                                This allows them to bypass traditional listings, saving both of you time, money, and
                                unnecessary frustration. 17 of the world’s top 100 agents work with Luxury Presence,
                                putting your agent in elite company that elevates them in both professionalism and
                                influence.
                                Choosing the right real estate agent is the most important decision you will make when
                                you’re ready to sell your home. When you work with an agent who has partnered with
                                Luxury Presence, you will be hiring one who has a powerful marketing team at his or her
                                side.
